<h2>AMONG THE AMATEURS.</h2>

<h3>No. III.&mdash;REALISATION.</h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Theatre Royal,
Blankbury, on the first night of the performance of the well-known
Comedy of</i> "Heads or Tails?" <i>by the "Thespian Perambulators."
Time</i>, 7:50 P.M. <i>A "brilliant and fashionable assemblage" is
gradually filling the house. In the Stalls are many distinguished
Amateurs of both Sexes, including</i>
Lady <span class="smcap">Surbiton</span>, <i>who has brought her
husband</i> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gagmore</span>
(Lady <span class="smcap">Surbiton's</span> <i>particular
friend</i>). <i>The rest of the Stalls are occupied by the immediate
friends and relations of the Actors. A few professional Critics are to
be seen. They are addressed with much politeness by the Amateurs in
front of the House, and "played to" with feverish anxiety by the
Amateurs on the Stage. The Orchestra is composed of excellent Amateur
Musicians. The Curtain has not yet risen.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Surbiton</i> (<i>to</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gagmore</span>). My dear, it's a wonder we ever
got here. <span class="smcap">Charles</span> of course forgot the date,
and told me only yesterday he'd invited some men to stay for a shoot. He
had to listen to reason, though, and so we spent all yesterday sending
telegrams to put them off. I've been at every performance of The
Thespians for years, and it wouldn't do to begin missing them now, would
it?</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Gagmore.</i> Certainly not, dear, it would have been quite a
calamity. There's the Duchess of <span class="smcap">Middlesex</span>
nodding to you.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> So it is. (<i>Smiles sweetly at the Duchess, who is
sitting three rows off.</i>) I call it scandalous of her to come out
like this when both her twins have got the measles. Did I tell you I
lent Mr. <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> my pet parrot, Penelope, for
this performance?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> No, dear. I didn't know they ever played it with a
parrot.</p>

<p><i>Lady S.</i> Well, they don't usually, but
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> told me that, after studying the
piece very very carefully, he had come to the conclusion that there
ought to be a parrot in <i>Lady Shorthorn's</i> drawing-room, and he
begged me to lend him mine. Fortunately it scarcely ever talks. Oh,
there's Mr. <span class="smcap">Penfold</span>! How old he's getting to
look. He never seems to have a good word to say for anyone in his
critiques. They're very late in beginning. I hope nothing has happened
to Penelope. Ah! at last.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Orchestra strikes up. After a few minutes the
Curtain rises on "the Drawing-room at Bullivant Court." Sc. 1, Act
1.</i> <span class="smcap">Harry Hall</span>, <i>in livery
as</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>the Footman, is reclining on a
sofa, reading a magazine. Penelope, in her cage, is a conspicuous object
on the</i> O.P. <i>side</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>John</i> (<i>yawning</i>). "Nothink in the <i>Fortnightly</i>, as
per usual. Heigh-ho! This is slow work. Who's that?"</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>, <i>the
Nursery-maid. The usual amatory scene follows. They both disappear,
as</i> <span class="smcap">Tiffington Spinks</span> <i>enters made up
as</i> "Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>," <i>with a saffron
complexion, a grey moustache, a red tie and an iron-grey wig. He
shivers. A great deal of preliminary applause. He bows with dignity,
conscious of his fame, and proceeds.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Col. Debenham.</i> "Ugh! how horribly cold this is. I shall have
to speak seriously to <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span> about the
state of his fires."</p>

<p><i>Penelope the Parrot</i> (<i>suddenly and with terrible
distinctness</i>). "Old fool!" [<i>A titter from the
irreverent.</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> <i>pays no heed to the
interruption.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Surbiton.</i> How awful! I declare I haven't heard Penelope
speak for six months. I hope to heaven she won't do it again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gagmore.</i> I thought it sounded so natural.</p>

<p><i>Lord S.</i> So it did, that's why it was so out of place. He's
getting on all right now, though.</p>

<p><i>Col. Debenham</i> (<i>concluding a peppery soliloquy</i>). "And as
for Lady <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span> and that spiteful cat of a
sister of hers, all I can say of <span class="smcap">Tom Debenham</span>
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Penelope</i> (<i>loudly</i>). "Old fool!"</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Whistles up and down the scale. Much
laughter.</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> <i>feels that violent
measures are necessary if the piece is not to be utterly ruined. He
perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span> <i>standing at the wings
made up as</i> <span class="smcap">Binns</span> <i>the Butler. A happy
thought flashes on him. He nods meaningly
at</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Col. Debenham</i> (<i>improvising gag</i>). "Oh, confound that
bird! I must have it removed. I'll ring for the butler."</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Rings.
Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Jarp</span> <i>as</i> <span
class="smcap">Binns</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Binns.</i> "'Er Ladyship's compliments,
Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>, and she would
like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Spinks</i> (<i>in a whisper of concentrated fury
to</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>). Not yet; take that infernal
parrot away, quick!</p>

<p><i>Jarp</i> (<i>loses his head; still the Butler is strong within
him</i>). "'Er Ladyship is served!"</p>

<p><i>Spinks</i> (<i>aloud</i>). "Oh, nonsense&mdash;nonsense, man!
You're an idiot. Here, take this bird, and kill it!"</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Seizes cage, thrusts it into the
flustered</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp's</span> <i>arms, and pushes him
off, the Parrot, horribly frightened, yelling, "Old
fool!"</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Surbiton.</i> How dare he speak of Penelope in that way? Kill
her! If Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarp</span> so much as lays a finger
upon her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord S.</i> She'll bite him. Oh, you may make your mind quite easy
about that parrot. She's bitten every finger of mine to the bone, and
I'm certain she's quite equal to defending herself
against <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Act proceeds without any further hitch,
until</i> <span class="smcap">Belinda</span> <i>wheels on her double
perambulator containing two red-headed infants, one of whom is terrified
into tears and calls for "Father!" in a shrill voice. After this
everything, however, goes well, and the Curtain falls amidst thunders of
applause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="subtitle smcap">Behind the Curtain.</p>

<p><i>Spinks.</i> Yes, <span class="smcap">Gushby</span>, I believe you
did it. You were closeted with that parrot for an hour yesterday. I
believe you deliberately taught it to say that, in order to crab my
part. What's more, I'm certain of it, for I distinctly recognised your
voice in the parrot's.</p>

<p><i>Gushby.</i> Pooh! nonsense! If I had taught it to say anything, it
would have been something worse than that, you may be sure.</p>

<p><i>Spinks.</i> You always were kind. As
for <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>, he was in the plot. Otherwise do
you think any man could have made such a fool of himself?</p>

<p class="subtitle smcap">In Front of the Curtain.</p>

<p><i>Lady Surbiton.</i> That's what I've always said. There's so much
<i>esprit de corps</i> and good feeling amongst Amateurs&mdash;none of that
wretched jealousy and bickering which ruins professionals.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gagmore.</i> It is delightful to listen to them, certainly.
They all look and act like perfect gentlemen. All
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarp's</span> Butlers are splendid. You can see
at a glance that they have only been with good families.</p>

<p class="subtitle smcap">Behind the Curtain.</p>

<p><i>Hon. B. Boldero.</i> I fancy we shall have good notices to-morrow
in the <i>Morning Moonbeam</i>. I saw <span class="smcap">Penfold</span>
laughing immensely.</p>

<p><i>Spinks</i> (<i>down on his luck</i>). Did you? (<i>Plucking up a
bit.</i>) Well, it "went" capitally. It was only that blessed
parrot.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Goes off intending to buy several copies of next
morning's "Moonbeam."</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="subtitle smcap">In Front of the Curtain.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Penfold</i> (<i>to his neighbour, a brother journalist</i>):
Are you going to write anything about this? I have got to do a short
notice for the <i>Morning Moonbeam</i>. It's no use abusing these
fellows. That's been tried. I'll give them a little butter this time,
and see whether that won't stop them. How would it do to say something
like this?&mdash;"We advise the Thespians to keep clear as much as they
can of professionalism. Of course, tradition demands that the ladies'
parts should be played by professionals, but the introduction of a
professional parrot and a professional baby in the First Act was a
mistake, which might have ruined the performance."</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>His Friend nods approval. Exeunt severally. Imagine
tableau next day. Delight of Amateurs on reading the notice of their
performance in the "Moonbeam."</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Did you see anything else that pleased you?</p>

<p><i>Master J. H.</i> You may be sure we
did! <span class="smcap">Polly</span> was a little frightened at first;
but when we found that the Royal Dane Boarhound and the Horse didn't

ought to go and see them. They are prime!</p>

<h2>SLAPS FOR SLIPPERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am at a loss to understand
what is the meaning of all this futile discussion as to the respective
merits of the various kinds of road pavement. There cannot be a moment's
doubt, as to which is, far and away, the cheapest, the safest,
and&mdash;in a word&mdash;the&mdash;best. Without any hesitation, I
maintain that it is the <i>Asphalte</i>. And I do not speak without
experience. For many years I have picked mine up from the box-seat of a
hearse, which I think my most virulent opponents will admit, from the
ticklish character of its cattle, accustomed as they are to a stiff,
formal and lugubrious method of progression, affords a test that must be
regarded as supreme by all candid and unprejudiced inquirers into the
matter under dispute.</p>

<p><i>In the wettest weather</i> I have never had so much as a slip on
the asphalte, whereas the moment I have got on to the wood, when it has
been <i>comparatively dry</i>, I have frequently had the horses down as
many as seven or eight times in half a mile, and on one occasion, that I
can recall, the stumbling was so frequent, that the Chief Mourner
stopped the procession, and sent me an irritable message to the effect
that, if I could not manage to keep my horses more securely on their
feet, I had better then and there "hand over the corpse, and let it
finish its journey to the Cemetery on the top of the first
mourning-coach." Fortunately, we came shortly to a bit of asphalte, on
which I was able to bowl merrily along, and make up for lost time; and,
as at length we reached the Cemetery only an hour and three-quarters
after the appointed time, the Chief Mourner, whatever may have been his
disposition to make complaints, had the good taste to keep them to
himself. Still, the incident was annoying, and I attribute its
occurrence simply and solely to that pest of all sure and stately-footed
hacks&mdash;<i>the Wood Pavement</i>.</p>

<p>Beyond holding three thousand Preference Shares in the <i>European
and Inter-oceanic Asphalte Paving Company</i>, and having signed a
contract to supply them for seventeen years with the best Pine Pitch on
favourable terms, I have not the slightest interest to subserve in
writing this letter, which I think any quite impartial critic will
allow, curtly, but honestly, expresses the unprejudiced opinion of</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">An Unbiassed Judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am a private gentleman, who
keeps a carriage, or rather, a four-horse coach, in which I am
continually driving about all over London at full speed. We dash at such
a rate over those portions of the Metropolis that are blessed with a
wood pavement that my coachman is frequently summoned for furious
driving, but we have never yet had a horse down. No sooner, however, do
we get to the asphalte than all this is changed. Leaders and wheelers
alike are instantly on their backs, and I have now made it a rule, the
moment we come to a street paved with this dangerous and detestable
composition, to put my horses inside the coach, and, with the assistance
of a policeman or two, drag the vehicle to the other end myself. Only
yesterday, I think it was, on the north side of Leicester Square, I
counted as many as nineteen ugly falls in as many minutes,
necessitating, in nearly every case, the despatch of the creature on the
spot by a shot from a revolver. The fact is, the laying of
<i>asphalte</i> anywhere should be made criminal in a Vestry. I write
impartially on this subject, as, beyond being a sleeping partner in a
large firm of Wooden Road-Paving Contractors, I have no sort of interest
to serve, one way or the other. But it must be obvious, from the account
I have given of my own personal experience above, that in addressing you
on the subject, I am actuated by no motives that are not consistent with
and fitting to the signature of</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">An Unprejudiced Observer</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am in no way interested in
the present pavement controversy, but I would direct public attention to
the real source of all the mischief, and that is the ineffective shoeing
of the unhappy horses, who are compelled to struggle with the
difficulties created for them by a parcel of Paving Authorities. What we
want is a general order issued by the Board of Trade obliging all
horse-owners to provide those they possess with a couple of pairs
of <i>The Patent India-rubber frog and flannel-soled Horse-Shoes</i>,
warranted to support the most stumbling beast on any pavement whatever.
I said I was in no way interested in the present controversy, and as I
am merely the Inventor of the shoe above referred to, it must be
obvious, that in making this communication to you, I am only fulfilling
the commonest duties of</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">An Ordinary Spectator</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Will not you, or someone, step
in and deal with the matter comprehensively, without paying regard to
vested interests? Surely, if the right people would only put their heads
together, they must hit on some method of bettering the present wretched
condition of those much ill-used but patient and long-suffering
creatures, among whom the first to subscribe himself is</p>

<h2>THE JUBILEE OF THE PENNY POST.</h2>

<p class="center">"On Jan. 10, 1840, the Penny Post became an accomplished
fact."&mdash;<i>Times</i>.</p>

<div class="poem" >

<div class="stanza">
<span class="smcap">Attend</span>, all ye who like to hear a noble Briton's praise!<br />
I tell of valiant deeds one wrought in the Century's early days:<br />
When all the legions of Red Tape against him tore in vain,<br />
Man of stout will, brave <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, of true heroic strain.
</div>

<div class="stanza">

It was about the gloomy close of Eighteen Thirty Nine,<br />
<span class="smcap">Melbourne</span> and <span class="smcap">Peel</span> began to melt, the P.O. "sticks" to pine,<br />
For vainly the Official ranks and the Obstructive host<br />
Had formed and squared 'gainst <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill's</span> plan, of the Penny Post.<br />
Still poor men paid their Ninepences for sending one thin sheet<br />
From Bethnal Green to Birmingham by service far from fleet;<br />
Still she who'd post a <i>billet doux</i> to Dublin from Thames shore,<br />
For loving word and trope absurd must stump up One-and-four;<br />
Still frequent "friendly lines" were barred to all save Wealth and Rank,<br />
Or Parliamentary "pots" who held the privilege of "Frank;"<br />
Still people stooped to dubious dodge and curious device<br />
To send their letters yet evade the most preposterous price;<br />
Still to despatch to London Town a business "line or two"<br />
Would cost a Connemara peasant half his weekly "screw;"<br />
Still mothers, longing much for news, must let their letter lie<br />
Unread at country post-offices, the postage being too high<br />
For their lean purses, unprepared. And Trade was hampered then,<br />
And Love was checked, and barriers raised&mdash;by cost&mdash;'twixt men and men.<br />
Then up and spake brave <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span> in accents clear and warm,<br />
"This misery can be mended! Read my <i>Post Office Reform</i>!"<br />
St. Stephens heard, and "Red Tape" read, and both cried out "Pooh! Pooh!<br />
The fellow is a lunatic; his plan will never do!"<br />
All this was fifty years ago. And now,&mdash;well, are there any<br />
Who do not bless brave <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span> and his ubiquitous Penny?<br />
One head, if 'tis a <i>thinking</i> one, is very often better<br />
Than two, or twenty millions! That's just why <i>we</i> get our letter<br />
From Aberdeen, or Melbourne, from Alaska or Japan,<br />
So cheaply, quickly, certainly&mdash;thanks to one stout-soul'd Man.
</div>

<div class="stanza">
Fifty years since! In Eighteen Forty, he, the lunatic,<br />
Carried his point. Wiseacres winced; Obstruction "cut its stick."<br />
He won the day, stout <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, and then they made him Knight.<br />
If universal benefit unmarred by bane gives right<br />
To titles, which are often won by baseness or a fluke,<br />
The founder of the Penny Post deserved to be a Duke.<br />
But then he's something better&mdash;a fixed memory, a firm fame;<br />
For long as the World "drops a line," it cannot drop his name.<br />
'Tis something like a Jubilee, this tenth of Janua-<i>ree</i>!<br />
<i>Punch</i> brims a bumper to its hero, cheers him three times three,<br />
For if there was a pioneer in Civilisation's host,<br />
It was the cheery-hearted chap who schemed the Penny Post.<br />
And when the croaking cravens, who are down on all Reform,<br />
And shout their ancient shibboleth, and raise their tea-pot storm,<br />
Whene'er there's talk of Betterment in any branch of State,<br />
And vent their venom on the Wise, their greed upon the Great,<br />
<i>Punch</i> says to his true countrymen, "Peace, peace, good friends&mdash;be still!<br />
Reform does <i>not</i> spell Ruin, lads. Remember <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>!!!"

<h2>A CURIOUS CURE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>, <i>January</i>13, 1890.</p>

<p>So much attention is now bestowed upon the prevailing epidemic that I
will not apologise for troubling you with a letter detailing a case that
has recently come under my own notice. My eldest
son, <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>, returned home from the
educational establishment admirably conducted by my eminent and reverend
friend, Dr. <span class="smcap">Swishtale</span>, apparently in
excellent health and spirits, shortly before Christmas Day. On the 4th
(just a week before the date fixed for his return to the educational
establishment to which I have referred) he showed symptoms of influenza.
He complained of low spirits, seemed inclined to quarrel with (and
thrash) his younger brothers, and flatly declined to accompany me to an
inspection of the treasures contained in the Natural Historical Museum
at South Kensington. I immediately prescribed for him a diet of bread
and water, and an enforced retirement to bed. He spent the remainder of
the day in loudly-expressed expostulation and lamentation. On the Sunday
(after a consultation with his mother) I decided to adopt a home
treatment of kindness, which I trusted would prevent the necessity of
calling in our family doctor. I give the remainder of the case in diary
form.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> very poorly.
Complains of pains in his head, arms, legs, back, nose, and right little
finger. Says he has no appetite, but, urged by his mother, manages to
eat for breakfast two sausages and a couple of eggs. Quite unable to get
up; but shortly before two o'clock, on learning that I proposed visiting
the Morning Performance at Her Majesty's Theatre, expresses his desire
to accompany me. He seemed to enjoy <i>Cinderella</i> thoroughly, in
spite of his ailments; but, at the conclusion of the performance, became
so very languid, that we found it desirable to take a Hansom home.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> prostrate.
Pain in the right little finger unconsciously shifted to the left little
finger. He says he had nightmare continuously, but "had not slept a
wink." Breakfast, of course, in bed. No appetite for anything save
muffins, herrings, and marmalade on buttered toast. Unable to move until
one o'clock, when he thought (at the suggestion of his mother) that a
visit to the Crystal Palace might probably do him good. The excursion
was a happy thought, as certainly he seemed quite himself at Sydenham.
After a hearty dinner from soup and the joint, he once more seemed
languid, and had to be carried home by rail and cab.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> still
very unwell. Seems much troubled at a dream he has had, in which he
apparently died through going back to school. Still complains of
insomnia. Says he did not close his eyes all night. Wished to "punch the
head" (to adopt his own phraseology) of his younger brother for saying,
that he had heard him snoring. However, recovered towards the evening
sufficiently to accompany the rest of the family to the Circus at Covent
Garden. In the theatre appeared more himself, but ill immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> (according
to his own account) alarmingly ill. Found by his bedside a medical
dictionary (taken from the shelves of my library) which he says, he had
been reading. He thinks, that he has all the worst symptoms
of <i>delirium tremens</i>. This is strange, as his habitual drink is
ginger-beer. He complains of pains in his ears, eyes, knees, elbows, and
big toes on both feet. Quite unable to get up before five o'clock, when
he was fortunately, sufficiently recovered to accompany his younger
brothers to a juvenile party and Christmas tree. According
to <span class="smcap">Sammy</span> (my second son)
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> danced every dance, and served as an
assistant to an amateur conjuror. But this last statement I give with
some reserve, as it does not correspond with the report furnished
by <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> himself.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus</span> at his
worst. In the morning he alarmed his mother by a passionate burst of
weeping. He seems to think that, if he goes back to school to-morrow, he
will die immediately. Feeling that this was an unhealthy state of mind,
I took him to the Zoological Gardens in the afternoon, and must confess
that, while there, he appeared to experience a keen delight in feeding
the bears with fragments of newspaper, concealed in stale buns. But at
night his melancholia returned, and he was scarcely able to eat his
dinner.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Received a letter from my eminent and reverend
friend, Dr. <span class="smcap">Swishtale</span>, informing me that, in
consequence of the prevalence of influenza, it had been thought
advisable to extend the Christmas vacation for a fortnight or three
weeks. On conveying this intelligence to my eldest son, he seemed to
rapidly recover, and has (I am happy to say) been well ever since.</p>

<p>Trusting that the history of this singular case may afford some hints
and comfort to parents with children afflicted (as was my dear
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span>) with a disease so eccentric in its ramifications as
influenza,</p>

<h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE CADI OF THE CURBSTONE.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A thoroughfare
near Hyde Park. Shortly before Scene opens, an Elderly Gentleman has
suddenly stopped the cab in which he has been driving, and, without
offering to pay the fare, has got out and shuffled off with a handbag.
The Cabman has descended from his seat and overtaken the old gentleman,
who is now perceived to be lamentably intoxicated. The usual crowd
springs up from nowhere, and follows the dispute with keen and delighted
interest.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Look 'ere, you ain't goin' not without
payin' <i>me</i>, you know&mdash;where's my two shillings?</p>

<p><i>The Elderly Gentleman</i> (<i>smiling sweetly, and balancing himself
on his heels against some railings</i>). I'm shure <i>I</i> dunno.</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Well, <i>look</i>, can't yer? don't keep me 'ere all
day&mdash;feel in yer pockets, come!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The Old Gentleman makes an abortive effort to find a
pocket about him somewhere, and then relapses into
abstraction.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Crowd.</i> Let 'im take 'is time, <i>he'll</i> pay yer right
enough, if you let the man alone.</p>

<p><i>A Woman.</i> Ah, pore gentleman, the best of us is took like that
sometimes!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Murmurs of sympathy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> I don't want no more than what's my own. 'E's rode in
my keb, and I want my fare out of 'im&mdash;an' I mean '<i>aving</i> it,
too!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Here the Old Gentleman, who seems bored by the
discussion, abruptly serpentines off again and is immediately overtaken
and surrounded.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> Wha' d'ye mean? 'founded 'perrinence! Lemme 'lone
... 'portant bishniss!</p>

<p><i>Cabman</i>. Pay me my fare,&mdash;or I'll have your bag!</p>

and always smiling</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Crowd.</i> Why can't yer pay the man his fare and have done with
it? There, he's feeling in his pockets&mdash;he's going to pay yer
now!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Elderly Gentleman dives vaguely in a pocket, and
eventually produces a threepenny bit, which he tenders
magnificently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Thruppence ain't no good <i>to me</i>&mdash;two
shillings is what I want out o' <i>you</i>&mdash;a florin&mdash;'j'ear
me?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>after another dive fishes up three
halfpence</i>). Thash all you're 'titled, to&mdash;go 'way, go 'way!</p>

<p><i>Crowd</i> (<i>soothingly to Cabman</i>). 'E'll make it up in
time&mdash;don't '<i>urry</i> 'im.</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> D' ye think I kin stand 'ere cooling my 'eels, while
he's payin' me a 'apn'y every 'arf 'our? I've got my living to earn same
as <i>you</i> 'ave!</p>

<p><i>Crowd.</i> Ah, he's right there! (<i>Persuasively to Elderly
Gentleman.</i>) 'Ere, Ole Guv'nor, fork out like a man!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The Old Guv'nor shakes his head at them with a
knowing expression.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Well, I shan't let go o' this 'ere bag till
I <i>am</i> paid&mdash;that's all!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Here a Policeman arrives on
scene.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Policeman.</i> Now, then, what's all this? Move along 'ere, all of
you&mdash;don't go blocking up the thoroughfare like this!
(<i>Scathingly</i>.) What are yer all <i>lookin'</i> at? (<i>The Crowd,
feeling this rebuke, move away some three paces, and then linger
undecidedly.</i>) 'Ere, Cabman, you've no right to lay 'old on that
gentleman's bag&mdash;<i>you</i> know that as well as I do!</p>

<p><i>Cabman</i> (<i>somewhat mollified by this tribute to his legal
knowledge, releases bag</i>). Well, <i>he</i> ain't got no right to ride
in my keb, and do a guy, without paying nothink, 'as he?</p>

<p><i>Policeman.</i> All I tell <i>you</i> is&mdash;you've no right to
detain his bag.</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Let 'im pay me my legal fare, then&mdash;two shillings
it is 'e owes <i>me</i>. I don't want to hinterfere with 'im, if he'll
pay me.</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>with a magnificent impartality, to the E. G.</i>).
What have you got to say to <i>that</i>?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>with a dignified wave of the hand</i>). Shay?
Why, tha' I'm shimply&mdash;a gerrilm'n.</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>his impartiality gradually merging into official
disgust</i>). Well, all I can say to <i>you</i> is, if you <i>are</i>
one, don't abuse it.... Where are you going to?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>brimming over with happy laughter</i>). <i>I</i>
dunno!</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>deciding to work on his fears</i>). Don't you?
Well, <i>I do</i>, then. I know where <i>you</i>'re goin' to&mdash;ah,
and where you'll <i>be</i>, too, afore you're much older&mdash;the
station-'us!&mdash;(<i>with a slight lapse into jocularity, in
concession to his audience</i>)&mdash;"for one night honly"&mdash;that's
<i>your</i> direction, unless you look out. (<i>With virtuous indignation.</i>)
'Ere are you&mdash;calling yourself a gentleman, and old enough
to know better&mdash;riding in this man's keb, and trying to bilk him out
of his money. Why, you ought to be <i>ashamed</i> o' yourself!</p>

<p><i>A Funny Onlooker.</i> Now, Policeman, why do you interfere? Why
can't you leave them to settle it between them?</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>turning on him with awful dignity</i>). I don't want
no suggestions from <i>you</i>, Sir. I know <i>my</i> dooty, and them as
tries to obstruck me'll get no good by it. I'm not 'ere to take one
man's part more than another.</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Well, ain't you goin' to do something now
you <i>are</i> here? What's the good of a Copper if he won't 'elp a man
to git his rights, eh?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Murmurs of sympathy from Crowd.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pol.</i> Now, you mind <i>your</i>self&mdash;that's
what <i>you</i>'d better do, or
<i>you</i>'ll be gitting into trouble next! I've told you I can't interfere
one way or the other; and&mdash;(<i>generally, to Crowd</i>)&mdash;you must pass
along 'ere, please, or I shall 'ave to make yer.</p>

<p><i>Crowd</i> (<i>to Eld. G.</i>). Give the man his money, can't yer?
Pay 'im!</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> Come, look sharp! Just you pay me!</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> How c'n I pay, man? P'fectly 'shurd! Go to
bleeshes!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Bolts again, and is once more overtaken by the
indignant Cabman.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>following up</i>). Now, then, Cabman, don't go
hustling him!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Crowd's sympathy veers round to the E. G.
again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> <i>'Oo's</i> 'ustlin'? I ain't laid a finger on 'im.
(<i>Magnanimously.</i>) I've no wish to 'inder 'im from going wherever
he likes, so long as he pays me fust!</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> You've no right to touch the man, nor yet his bag; so be
careful, that's all I tell you!</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>with maudlin enthusiasm</i>). Pleeshman's
perfelly ri'! Pleeshman always knowsh besht!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Tries to pat Policeman on back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>his disgust reaching a climax</i>). 'Ere, don't you
go pawin' <i>me</i> about&mdash;for I won't '<i>ave</i> it!
If <i>I'm</i> right, it's more than what <i>you</i> are, anyhow! Now be
off with you, wherever it is you're going to!</p>

<p><i>Cabman</i> (<i>desperate</i>). But look 'ere&mdash;can't you take
his name and address?</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>rising to the occasion</i>). Ah! that's what I was
waitin' for! Now you've <i>ast</i> me&mdash;now I kin <i>act</i>!
(<i>Pulls out a pocket-book full of dirty memoranda, and a stumpy
pencil.</i>) Now then, Sir, your name, if <i>you</i> please?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>sleepily</i>). Shtupid thing a-do, but qui'
forgot.... Come out 'ithout mi' name, 'shmornin'!</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). That won't do with Me, you know. What's
your name? Out with it!</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>evidently making a wild shot at
it</i>). <span class="smcap">Fergushon</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Smiles, as if he feels sure the Policeman will be

what?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> You can purr 'em all down t' me&mdash;it don'

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>briskly</i>). Where do you live,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ferguson</span>?</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>mechanically</i>). Shirty-one, Lushington
Street, Gargleshbury Park.</p>

<p><i>Pol.</i> (<i>writing it down, and giving leaf to Cabman</i>).
There, will <i>that</i> do for you?</p>

<p><i>Cabman.</i> That's all <i>I</i> want. (<i>To the E. G.</i>) You'll 'ear from
me later on.</p>

<p><i>The E. G.</i> (<i>affectionately</i>). Alwaysh pleash'd shee you,

<p><i>Jones</i> (<i>following the example</i>). Quite so, Sir&mdash;not
much.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Perhaps, Sir, the most interesting item is this talk
about London Improvement.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> So I think, Sir. But what do we want with this plan for
widening the Strand, and making a road to Holborn? It seems to me, Sir,
that the suburbs are being neglected.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> I agree with you, Sir. Now, if they would develop the
North of London, it would be more to the purpose. If they would run a
road direct from Charing Cross to, say Zanzibar Terrace, Upper Kensal
Green, West, it would really be of service to the public.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Very likely, Sir&mdash;very likely. For my part, it
seems to me that Chiswick also requires a helping hand. The construction
of a broad boulevard running from Charing Cross in a straight line to,
say, Upham Park Road, would tend to show that the County Council justly
appreciated its own responsibilities. And I say this, knowing the
necessities of Chiswick, for in that neighbourhood I happen to
reside.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> And I, too, Sir, am equally cognisant of the
requirements of Upper Kensal Green West. As a matter of fact, Sir, I
happen to have a comfortable house in Zanzibar Terrace.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> And I, Sir, a delightful villa in Upham Park Road.</p>

<h2>OLD COLDS FOR NEW.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Fairy Tale of Anglo-Russian Origin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a feeble little
Ailment called "Cold-in-the-head," which was treated in the most
contemptuous fashion by its relations. The nearest of its kith and
kin&mdash;Measles and Scarlatina&mdash;absolutely laughed when its name
was mentioned, and scarcely recognised it as a connection. So
Cold-in-the-head had rather a bad time of it generally.</p>

<p>One day the feeble little Ailment was wandering aimlessly about
in search of a resting-place, when it came upon an enormous establishment
thronged with thousands of working-men. When the
<i>employ&eacute;s</i> are described as "working-men," it is not,
however, quite accurate, for at that moment they were not working.</p>

<p>"Why are you idle?" sneezed out little Cold-in-the-head in a tone of
compassion.</p>

<p>"Because," replied one of the <i>employ&eacute;s</i>, rather gruffly,
"there is nothing to do. If you want further information, you had better
inquire at that office."</p>

<p>And the man pointed to a door bearing the legend, "Editor's Room."
The poor little Ailment entered the apartment, and found a Gentleman
seated in front of a desk covered with papers. The Gentleman was staring
before him, and the ink in his pen had dried up.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the Gentleman. "And why don't you shut the
door behind you?"</p>

<p>"I should cease to exist without draughts," explained the poor little
Ailment, "and please don't speak roughly to me, as I want to help
you."</p>

<p>"You help me!" exclaimed the Editor&mdash;for the Gentleman was an
Editor. "How can you do that?"</p>

<p>"I think I can give you a subject."</p>

<p>"You are very welcome if you can do that," was the reply, "as in this
dead season of the year ideas are as scarce as coals; nay scarcer. But
surely, didn't you do something for the Press ages ago?"</p>

<p>"That was in the 'forties;' but I am quite different now."</p>

<p>Then the little Ailment related to the Editor stories of Russia, and
the East, and all sorts of wonderful things.</p>

<p>"Well," murmured the Editor, after some consideration, "I think you
may be useful, after all, if we are helped by the Doctors."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"What a fuss they are making about this new rival of ours!" said
Measles, angrily.</p>

<p>"Too absurd!" commented Scarlatina, in a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p>Then there was a grand procession. First came Correspondents, then
Interviewed Physicians, then the General Public. It was a sight that had
never been seen before. In the midst of the excitement an Ailment
appeared.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me!" cried Measles. "Only fancy!"</p>

<p>"Can I believe my eyes?" shouted Scarlatina. "Why, it's poor little
Cold-in-the-head, that no one used to care a jot about six months
ago!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" said the Ailment, with great dignity. "You must learn to
treat me with the respect due to my exalted station. And please don't
call me 'Cold-in-the-head,' for I am known as 'The Russian
Influenza!'"</p>

<p>Then the Ailment turned towards <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who (as was his
wont) was smiling, and bade him do homage.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," exclaimed the Sage of Fleet Street, raising a
glass of Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine to his lips, and quaffing
merrily a teaspoonful. "I defy you! You are puffed up with conceit, my
poor little Illness, and when, in a few weeks' time, we have another
sensation to talk and think about, you will sink back into your native
obscurity."</p>

<p>And <i>Mr. Punch</i> (as the event will prove) was&mdash;as he always
is&mdash;entirely right!</p>

<h2>A COMING BIG BORE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Being a probable Extract from the "City
Intelligence" for 1900.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> half-yearly meeting to discuss the
Report just issued by the Chairman and Directors of the Amalgamated
International Anglo-French Submarine Channel Tunnel Railway Company was
held in the Company's Fortress Boardroom yesterday afternoon, and, owing
to the present critical Continental outlook, as might have been
expected, succeeded in securing the attendance of an unusually large
number of shareholders.</p>

<p>The Chairman, who on rising was received with prolonged hooting and a
chorus, again and again renewed <i>con amore</i> by the assembled
audience, of "<i>And he's a jolly bad fellow!</i>" having, at length,
though frequently interrupted, obtained something like a hearing, was
understood to say, that he had little to offer in the shape of comment
on the Report submitted to the meeting. (<i>Groans.</i>) The causes of
its unsatisfactory nature were patent to all. Owing to their having been
compelled, in what he now fully recognised was a slavish and mistaken
obedience to a popular clamour (<i>a Voice, "You're right!</i>"), three
years ago, in the height of a sudden scare about invasion&mdash;("<i>Oh!
oh!</i>")&mdash;to let the water in and flood the
Tunnel&mdash;(<i>groans</i>)&mdash;they had been occupied ever since in
pumping it out again, and though now he was glad to announce that the
last bucketful had been emptied out, and that the traffic would be
resumed forthwith&mdash;(<i>cheers</i>)&mdash;still the operation had
cost them three millions of money, that they had to get from the market
in the shape of Seventeen per Cent. First Preference
Debentures&mdash;("<i>Oh! oh!</i>")&mdash;on which, however, he trusted
that a favourable season's receipts might enable them possibly to pay a
next half-year's dividend of three and sixpence. (<i>Prolonged
groans.</i>) It was not much; still, it was something. ("<i>Oh!
oh!</i>") But if they wished to secure even this modest remuneration for
their money, they must make up their minds, especially at the present
moment, when there was a daily,&mdash;he might almost say, an
hourly,&mdash;expectation of the withdrawal of their Ambassador from
Paris, that there must be no more craven yielding to delusive impulses
of an idiotic patriotism&mdash;(<i>loud cheers</i>),&mdash;in a word, no
more talk about closing the Tunnel on the paltry plea of "national
security." (<i>Prolonged cheering.</i>) He was glad to hear those
cheers. It was an endorsement of the standpoint that he and his
Directors meant to take in the present crisis, which was, in effect, to
remind themselves that they were shareholders of the Anglo-French
Submarine Channel Tunnel Railway Company first&mdash;and Englishmen
afterwards&mdash;(<i>thunders of applause, and loud and prolonged
cheering</i>);&mdash;and that, if called upon to shed their life's
blood, it would be solely in defence of that great engineering work, the
true monument of peace, in which their aspirations, their hopes, and,
above all, their capital, had been so fearlessly embarked and largely
invested.(<i>Renewed enthusiasm.</i>)</p>

<p>A Shareholder here rose, and said, that if there really was, as the
Chairman seemed to imply, a probability that war with our friendly
neighbours might break out at any minute, would it not be advisable, in
the interests of the Company, to come to some amicable and therefore
satisfactory commercial arrangement for the transit of troops through
the Tunnel, which, no doubt, it would be their first object to
secure.(<i>Laughter.</i>) There might possibly be some stupid attempt of
our own Government forces to seize upon and even damage, with a view to
rendering the Tunnel useless, the works commanding this end of it.
Should not a Volunteer Corps of Shareholders be at once
organised&mdash;("<i>Hear! hear!</i>")&mdash;for the purpose of keeping
them until the French Military Authorities came over in sufficient force
to enable them to seize and securely hold them against all comers? He
trusted he was not wanting in a well-balanced and legitimate
patriotism&mdash;("<i>No! no!</i>")&mdash;but like their respected
Chairman, he felt that there was a higher claim, a louder call than that
addressed to an Englishman by his country, and that was the deep, grim,
stern and stirring appeal made to the Seventeen per Cent.
Debenture-holder by his Company.(<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>Considerable uproar here arose over the ejection from the meeting of
a protesting Shareholder, who injudiciously proposed an Amendment to the
Report to the effect that, "In the face of grave National danger, the
Company ought to be prepared, even if it involved serious financial
loss, to close their Tunnel, if such a step should be regarded as
necessary to the security of the country by the military advisers of the
Government." This proposition was howled down, and the Chairman was
again about to address the now somewhat quieted meeting, when a copy of
an evening paper, announcing the declaration of war, and the
simultaneous seizure of the British end of the Tunnel that morning by
two hundred French troops, who had crossed from Boulogne by yesterday's
evening Mail-boat, and had passed the night at Folkestone in disguise,
was handed up on to the platform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chairman</span> (<i>after reading out the
various items of intelligence to the Audience, who listened to them with
breathless excitement</i>). Well, Gentlemen, in the face of this not
entirely unsuspected news&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)-our course is, I
think, pretty clear. We must at once dispatch a deputation to make the
best terms we can with the French General in command, for the transit of
the one or two, or even three hundred thousand troops they propose to
bring over. (<i>Cheers.</i>) Even if we get only an excursion fare out
of them, it will be something. ("<i>Hear, hear!</i>") And, at least, we
shall be able to congratulate ourselves on this occasion with a sterling
and heartfelt satisfaction that, whether the country go to the dogs or
not&mdash;(<i>roars of laughter</i>)&mdash;the property of the Company
will, at any rate, be preserved. (<i>Enthusiastic applause.</i>) The
Chairman, who continued his address amid mingled cheers and laughter in
the same strain, having submitted the names to form the proposed
deputation to the meeting, the Shareholders dispersed, apparently in the
highest spirits, singing a parody of the great national ditty, in which
the line, "<i>Britons ever, ever, ever will be knaves</i>," with an
accompaniment of loud guffaws of laughter, struck the listening ear, as
they betook themselves to their respective homes.</p>

<h2>THE PILFERER.</h2>

<p class="center smcap">To all Volapuk-speaking Folk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> exists at this moment no institution
which even aspires to be to the Volapuk-speaking world what We were
whilst still We remained in Northumberland Street, and looked after
things generally. The wise are few. The governing minds are never
numerous. But We have one, and We have determined to expand it over a
new Monthly Magazine. At the outset We, being, after all, human, were
confronted by the difficulty of finding a title. Several suggested
themselves to a Mind not lacking in scope. A few may be mentioned. There
was the <i>Filibuster</i>; the <i>Summum Bone-'em</i>; <i>Macheath's
Miscellany</i>; the <i>Monthly Marauder</i>; the <i>Eviscerator</i>;
the <i>Literary Leech</i>; the <i>Monthly Misappropriator</i>;
the <i>Sixpenny Scoop</i>. Each has its particular attraction and
appropriateness. But, having submitted the selection of titles for the
consideration of some of the foremost men of letters, lawyers, soldiers,
scientists, and divines of our time, with a request for an expression of
their opinion, we decided upon the title which appears at the head of
these few preliminary remarks. We are the <i>Pilferer</i>, price
sixpence, published monthly; a reduction on taking a quantity.</p>

<p>The <i>Pilferer</i> will not be a colourless reflection of public
opinion for the time being. It will certainly not be a Party organ, and
that for sufficient reason. Neither Party has at this moment any
distinctive body of doctrine, any well-conceived system of faith, which
would justify Us in labelling Our new monthly with a Party badge.
Moreover than which, We have some reason to believe that neither Party,
nor any subdivision of Party, particularly cares to be associated with
Us. We shall therefore be independent of Party, because, having a very
clear, intelligible belief in Ourselves, We are able to survey the
struggles of contending parties from the standpoint of sublime egotism.
We are the man who can interpret the best thought of his day in such a
manner as to render it accessible to the general intelligence of Our
age. We are the true Prophet of Our time, and We hope to make a modest
profit out of Our new venture. Hence, Our first starting point will be a
deep and almost awestruck regard for the destinies of the
Volapuk-speaking race. The American Republic we especially take under
our wing (price of the Magazine in the United States 50 cents.), whilst
we work for the Empire, seek to strengthen it, to develop it, and, when
necessary, to extend it. We believe in Ourselves, in England, and in
Humanity. We are not mad. We do not "hear them dancing in the hall," as
used to happen when <span class="smcap">Henry Russell</span> still
filled the stage of the Concert Hall. But we have our mission, which is
to hold the world straight, keep ourselves <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>,
and earn a modest living.</p>

<p>How is this to be done? By the preaching of a man who energises the
activity of the Church by the ideals of chivalry and the production of a
Sixpenny Monthly, made up of pickings from other people's pockets.
Visible in many ways is the decadence of the Daily Press since We left
it. The Mentor of Young Democracy has abandoned philosophy, and stuffs
the ears of his <span class="smcap">Telemachus</span> with the skirts
of <span class="smcap">Calypso's</span> petticoats, the latest scandals
of the Court, and the prurient purrings of abandoned womankind in places
where you accept the unaccustomed cigar, and drink the unfamiliar
champagne. All the more need, then, that there should be a Voice which,
like that of the Muezzin from the Eastern minaret, shall summon the
Faithful to the duties imposed by their belief. We go into this waste
land to possess it. It is capable of being made to flourish as of old
under the stimulating radiance of a great ideal, and the diligent and
intelligent culture of one who, like Ourselves, has the capacity for
direction.</p>

<p>Who will help Us? There is not a street in London, nor a village in
the country, which is not capable of producing, even at short notice,
and under slight pressure, a man or a woman who will spend two hours a
week, every week in the year, in more or less irksome voluntary exertion
in order to sell the <i>Pilferer</i>. To such we say, "If, by
canvassing, or otherwise, you secure, say, six subscribers,
the <i>Pilferer</i> shall be sent to you as long as the six continue
their subscriptions." In this case, the subscriptions should be paid in
advance.</p>

<p>Are there any among the readers of the <i>Pilferer</i> craving for
counsel, for sympathy, and for the consolation of pouring out their
soul's grief at so much a quart, so to speak? If so, may we ask them to
communicate with Us? Their cases, as they submit them, will be placed
before such competent and skilful advisers as We are able to gather
round Us from the best men and women in the Volapuk-speaking world.
Their confidences will be printed free of cost, and, touched up with the
literary art that shaped many a spicy series, are likely to produce copy
at once tasty and cheap. We have a heap of letters and post-cards from
eminent persons to whom we submitted the design lightly sketched above.
They may be known as "Some Letters of Marque to the Editor of
the <i>Literary Privateer</i>."</p>
